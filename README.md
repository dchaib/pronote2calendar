# Pronote2Calendar

**Pronote2Calendar** exports your **Pronote** timetable to **Google Calendar** so you can easily access it and integrate it with other applications.

## Features

- **Sync your Pronote timetable**: Export your Pronote school timetable to a Google Calendar.
- **Supports Pronote accounts**: Works with both **parent** and **child** accounts.
- **Configurable sync period**: Specify the number of days (from today) to sync.
- **Automated & Ephemeral**: Designed to run, sync, and stop. Best suited for running on a schedule (e.g., via cron).

## Prerequisites

To use **Pronote2Calendar**, you will need the following:

- A **Pronote account** (parent or child).
- A **Google Service account** with calendar access.

### Pronote account

To interact with your Pronote account, you need to set up credentials. Use the `init` command provided in the Docker image to generate the necessary configuration file.

Using the QR code login method (recommended):

1. Log in to your Pronote account.
2. Generate the QR code. Note the PIN you entered.

3. Read the QR code with any QR code reader app. You should get a JSON object like this:

    ```json
    {"avecPageConnexion":false,"jeton":"13895...AAB","login":"477...65","url":"https://<school_id>.index-education.net/pronote/..."}
    ```

4. Run the `init` command from the Docker image to generate credentials:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/dchaib/pronote2calendar:latest init --qr_code '<your QR code>' --pin <your PIN>
    ```

5. Copy the credentials from the output to a file named `credentials-pronote.json`. Example structure:

    ```json
    {
        "pronote_url": "https://<school_id>.index-education.net/pronote/...",
        "username": "xxxxxxxxxx",
        "password": "627AE53B...",
        "client_identifier": "45A64E1...",
        "uuid": "0cb7f2459..."
    }
    ```

You can also use your username and password (if you have one). Simply run the `init` command without arguments and follow the instructions:
```bash
docker run --rm -it ghcr.io/dchaib/pronote2calendar:latest init
```

### Google service account

To modify your Google Calendar, you need a Google service account and a service account key (JSON).

1. Create a Google Cloud project (if you don't have one): https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project
2. Enable the Google Calendar API: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com
3. Create a service account: https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#create_a_service_account
4. Create and download a service account key in JSON format: https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#create_credentials_for_a_service_account
5. Save the downloaded JSON as `credentials-google.json`.
6. Share the Google Calendar you want to use with the service account and grant the permission "Make changes to events".


## Setup

### 1. Configuration File (`config.json`)

Create a `config.json` file in the root of your project directory. Here's an example with a `child` account:

```json
{
    "pronote": {
        "connection_type": "token",
        "account_type": "child"
    },
    "google_calendar": {
        "calendar_id": "xxx@gmail.com"
    },
    "max_days": 20
}
```

Here is an example with a `parent` account:
```json
{
    "pronote": {
        "connection_type": "token",
        "account_type": "parent",
        "child": "<child_name>"
    },
    "google_calendar": {
        "calendar_id": "xxx@gmail.com"
    },
    "max_days": 20
}
```

* **pronote.connection_type**: Defines how you connect to Pronote. There are 2 options, depending on what you used to generate the credentials:
  - `token` if you used the QR code,
  - `password` if you used your username and password.
* **pronote.account_type**: Can be either `parent` or `child` depending on the account you used.
* **pronote.child**: Only needed if using a **parent** account; specify the name of your child as shown in Pronote.
* **google_calendar.calendar_id**: The **ID** of your Google Calendar (can be found in Google Calendar settings).
* **max_days**: The number of days (including today) to sync. Example: If set to `20`, it will sync the next 20 days.

### 2. Create your Docker Compose file

You can use **Docker Compose** to run the container. Here is an example:

```yaml
services:
  pronote2calendar:
    image: "ghcr.io/dchaib/pronote2calendar:latest"
    volumes:
      - "./config.json:/app/config.json:ro"
      - "./credentials-google.json:/app/credentials-google.json:ro"
      - "./credentials-pronote.json:/app/credentials-pronote.json:rw"
```

If you are using the QR code login method, the Pronote credentials file needs write permissions (`rw`) because the password is updated after each login. Otherwise, you can keep it read-only (`ro`).

To keep the example simple, it uses the `latest` tag. For reproducibility, you should pin a specific tagged image in production.

It also assumes that all the configuration files (`config.json`, `credentials-google.json`, and `credentials-pronote.json`) are in the same directory as your compose file.


## Running the App

After setting everything up, you can run the container using Docker Compose. Since the container is ephemeral, it will run, sync your calendar, and then stop automatically.

If all goes well, you should see the logs similar to those:
```

```

### Recommended: Schedule Regular Syncs

If you want to sync regularly (and you most likely do), it is best to run it on a schedule (e.g., using `cron`) to sync your timetable at regular intervals, without overwhelming the Pronote servers. For example, running it daily would be a good starting point:

```bash
0 0 * * * cd /path/to/compose/file && docker compose up -d
```

This would run the synchronization at midnight every day.


## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

* **Pronote Login Issues**: If you're unable to log in, ensure that your `credentials-pronote.json` file is properly generated by running the `init` command. If you used the QR code, the file needs write permissions for the app to update the password after each login.
* **Google Calendar Permissions**: Make sure your Google Service account has proper permissions to make changes to events.
